There are support groups for people with any experience of mental illness, support groups for people with a specific diagnosis, support groups for family members and friends, and more. \\n Support groups are offered by community organizations, mental health service providers, schools, campuses, and support agencies. Here are some general resources to help you find a mental health or substance use related support group in BC: \\n Talk to your mental health care provider. They might be able to make recommendations. \\n The Mood Disorders Association of BC offers a network of peer support groups around the province for people who experience mental illnesses like mood disorders or post-traumatic stress disorder. They also have groups for family and friends. Groups are drop-in. \\n Many Canadian Mental Health Association branches offer support services, including support groups. If your local branch doesn’t have their own program, they can recommend other services in your community. \\n The BC Schizophrenia Society maintains a directory of support groups and other regular events for family members of people with a mental illness. \\n For groups related to alcohol or drug use, call the Alcohol and Drug Information Referral Service at 1-800-663-1441 or 604-660-9382 in the Lower Mainland. \\n For groups in the Lower Mainland, search the Red Book Online. \\n If you are at school or on campus, talk to a school counsellor or your campus’ health and wellness office. \\n For online support, see some suggestions at www.heretohelp.bc.ca/discuss. This can be particularly useful if you don’t have a group in your community or have trouble getting to an in-person group. \\n In order to benefit the most from a support group, you need to feel safe enough to share your experiences and thoughts, and you need to feel comfortable supporting others. It can be helpful to contact the group facilitator or organizer ahead of time to see if a particular group might be a good fit for you. We have a checklist to help you evaluate support groups—including when it might be time to leave one. \\n Sometimes a group just doesn’t work for you, and that’s okay. If you feel comfortable, you can try talking to the facilitator to see if they can recommend another group that you can try.', metadata={'row': 46, 'source': 'How can I find a support group?'}),\n",

              " 'source_documents': [Document(page_content=\"Question_ID: 9100298\\nQuestions: How can I maintain social connections? What if I feel lonely?\\nAnswers: A lot of people are alone right now, but we don't have to be lonely. We're all in this together. \\n While you may be physically separated from friends, family members, and other loved ones, it has never been more important to maintain those social connections. Social connections are an opportunity to seek and share support, talk through difficult feelings, share a laugh, keep up-to-date with loved ones, and help each other cope. This pandemic is a lot for one person to deal with on their own. While measures like physical distancing and self-isolation are necessary to slow the spread of the virus, the physical separation can amplify a lot of challenging emotions like loneliness and fear. \\n Think about the different ways to connect that are most meaningful for you. For example, you might prefer a video chat over a phone call, or you might prefer to text throughout the day rather than one set time for a video call. Then, work with your social networks to make a plan. You might video chat with your close friends in the evening and phone a family member once a week. \\n Remember to be mindful of people who may not be online. Check in by phone and ask how you can help. \\n The quality of your social connections matter. Mindlessly scrolling through social media and liking a few posts usually doesn't build strong social connections. Make sure you focus on strategies that actually make you feel included and connected. If your current strategies don't help you feel connected, problem-solve to see if you can find a solution. \\n Everyone feels lonely at times—maybe you recently moved to a new city, are changing your circle of friends, lost someone important in your life, or lost your job and also lost important social connections with coworkers. Other people may have physical connections to others but may feel like their emotional or social needs aren't met. Measures like social distancing or self-isolation can make loneliness feel worse no matter why you feel lonely now. \\n Reach out to the connections you do have. Suggest ways to keep in touch and see if you can set a regular time to connect. People may hesitate to reach out for a lot of different reasons, so don't be afraid to be the one who asks. \\n Look for local community support groups and mutual aid groups on social media. This pandemic is bringing everyone together, so look for opportunities to make new connections. These groups are a great way to share your skills and abilities or seek help and support. \\n Look for specialized support groups. Support groups are moving online, and there are a lot of different support lines to call if you need to talk to someone.

              "  Document(page_content=\"Question_ID: 9250044\\nQuestions: How can I use distraction to manage difficult thoughts or feelings?\\nAnswers: Distraction is a very valid tool to help you cope when everything feels overwhelming or when you feel lonely or isolated. \\n If you don't have a lot of energy or focus right now, try low-effort distractions like watching TV, browsing Youtube, listening to a podcast or audiobook, playing a game on your phone, reading an easy book or magazine, or working on a simple art project. \\n If you have more energy and focus, give yourself a to-do list every day: you can clean and take care of projects around your home, work on hobbies, connect with family or friends, read a new book and catch up on your favourite TV shows. You can find interesting opportunities to take online courses from universities all over the world through MOOCs and other online learning platforms, you can learn a new language online or through apps, and you can learn new hobbies and activities. As more people have to practice social distancing or self-isolation, people are finding creative ways to bring the world into their homes: you can tour museums and art galleries, Skype with a scientist, watch animals at zoos and nature preserves, and more. \\n When normal schedules are disrupted, it's easy to fall into unhelpful habits. Look for ways to keep yourself on track with healthier habits. You could set yourself goals every day or turn activities into a fun competition with friends or family—whoever takes the most language classes wins! \\n Many communities are using social media platforms like Facebook to organize support and help for neighbours. If you are healthy and it's safe to do so, you can sign up to walk dogs, pick up groceries and household supplies, and help others who can't go out at the moment. This can be a great way to make new connections in your area, and helping others is good for your own mental health. Just be sure to follow good hygiene practices and physical distancing—your own health is important.\", metadata={'row': 38, 'source': 'How can I use distraction to manage difficult thoughts or feelings?'}),\n",
              "  Document(page_content=\"Question_ID: 6062232\\nQuestions: What's the difference between sadness and depression?\\nAnswers: Sadness is a normal reaction to a loss, disappointment, problems, or other difficult situations. Feeling sad from time to time is just another part of being human. In these cases, feelings of sadness go away quickly and you can go about your daily life. \\n Other ways to talk about sadness might be ‘feeling low,’ ‘feeling down,’ or ‘feeling blue.’ A person may say they are feeling ‘depressed,’ but if it goes away on its own and doesn’t impact life in a big way, it probably isn’t the illness of depression. \\n Depression is a mental illness that affects your mood, the way you understand yourself, and the way you understand and relate to things around you. It can also go by different names, such as clinical depression, major depressive disorder, or major depression. Depression can come up for no reason, and it lasts for a long time. It’s much more than sadness or low mood. People who experience depression may feel worthless or hopeless. They may feel unreasonable guilty. Some people may experience depression as anger or irritability. It may be hard to concentrate or make decisions. Most people lose interest in things that they used to enjoy and may isolate themselves from others. There are also physical signs of depression, such as problems with sleep, appetite and energy and unexplainable aches or pains. Some may experience difficult thoughts about death or ending their life (suicide). Depression lasts longer than two weeks, doesn’t usually go away on its own, and impacts your life. It’s a real illness, and it is very treatable.

People with SPD may have a hard time relating to others and showing emotions. They may avoid close relationships and prefer to spend their time alone, seeming distant even to close family members.

Nausea is a common symptom of anxiety because it's a way for your body to try to get rid of the stress hormones that are coursing through your system. \\nThere are a few things you can do to help manage your anxiety and nausea. \\n**1. ** **Take deep breaths.** When you feel anxious, your breathing becomes shallow and rapid. This can make you feel even more anxious and nauseous. Taking slow, deep breaths can help to slow your heart rate and calm your nerves. \\n**2. ** **Practice relaxation techniques.** There are many different relaxation techniques that can help to reduce anxiety and nausea. Some popular options include yoga, meditation, and progressive muscle relaxation. \\n**3. ** **Get enough sleep.** When you're sleep-deprived, your body produces more stress hormones, which can make you feel more anxious and nauseous. Aim for 7-8 hours of sleep each night. \\n**4. ** **Eat a healthy diet.** Eating a healthy diet can help to improve your overall health and well-being, which can help to reduce anxiety and nausea. Make sure to eat plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. \\n**5. ** **Reduce your caffeine and alcohol intake.** Caffeine and alcohol can both worsen anxiety and nausea. Try to limit your intake of these substances, especially if you're feeling anxious. \\n**6. ** **Talk to a therapist.** If your anxiety is severe or is interfering with your life, it's important to talk to a therapist. A therapist can help you learn coping mechanisms to manage your anxiety and nausea. \\nIn the meantime, know that you're not alone. Many people are feeling anxious and nauseous right now. It's important to be kind to yourself and give yourself time to heal.\",\n",

Stress is related to the same ‘fight, flight, or freeze’ response as anxiety, and the physical sensations of anxiety and stress may be very similar. \\n The cause of stress and anxiety are usually different, however. Stress focuses on mainly external pressures on us that we’re finding hard to cope with. When we are stressed, we usually know what we’re stressed about, and the symptoms of stress typically disappear after the stressful situation is over. \\n Anxiety, on the other hand, isn’t always as easy to figure out. Anxiety focuses on worries or fears about things that could threaten us, as well as anxiety about the anxiety itself. Stress and anxiety are both part of being human, but both can be problems if they last for a long time or have an impact on our well-being or daily life.\", metadata={'row': 76, 'source': \"What's the difference between anxiety and stress?\"}),\n",
              "  Document(page_content='Question_ID: 4893447\\nQuestions: What’s the difference between anxiety and an anxiety disorder?\\nAnswers: Anxiety is a normal reaction to many different kinds of events and situations in our lives. Anxiety is one of our internal warning systems that alerts us to danger or other threats and prepares our bodies to fight back or get out of a dangerous situation. (Scientists call this the ‘fight, flight, or freeze’ response.) \\n A manageable amount of anxiety from time to time can be helpful. For example, it can motivate you to prepare for a test a school or finish a task at work. Even happy events like moving to a new home or celebrating an important milestone can bring up anxiety—all of this is just part of being human. \\n Anxiety is a problem when it becomes overwhelming or unmanageable and it comes up unexpectedly. Anxiety disorders are mental illnesses that have a big impact your life. People may avoid going about their daily lives in order to avoid anxiety. They may experience a lot of uncomfortable physical sensations and physical health problems. Many people say that they know their anxiety isn’t based in reality, but they feel ‘trapped’ by their thought and feelings. Anxiety disorders can be treated. It’s important to seek help if you’re concerned about anxiety in your life. \\n Normal anxiety... \\n Is related to a specific situation or problem \\n Lasts only as long as the situation or problem/p> \\n Is proportional to the situation or problem/p> \\n Is a realistic response to a realistic problem or situation/p> \\n When someone experiences an anxiety disorder... \\n Anxiety may come up unexpectedly, for seemingly no reason \\n The anxiety response to a situation or problem may be much stronger that they would expect \\n They may experience a lot of unrealistic anxiety, such as fear of a situation that likely will never happen \\n Anxiety may last for a long time, even when the situation or problem has been resolved \\n Anxiety may feel impossible to control or manage \\n They may avoid situations or things that they believe to trigger anxiety symptoms \\n Here’s an example of normal anxiety and an anxiety disorder. Many people are a bit nervous about flying, which is a totally normal reaction. Yet, if they have to travel for work, they can can get on a plane without any problems. Someone with an anxiety disorder, on the other hand, may not be able to travel to the airport—even if it puts their job in jeopardy. \\n *Formerly classified as an anxiety disorder and currently classified as Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders \\n **Formerly classified as an anxiety disorder and currently classified as Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders', metadata={'row': 75, 'source': 'What’s the difference between anxiety and an anxiety disorder?'}),\n",
              "  Document(page_content='Question_ID: 3597720\\nQuestions: How can I reframe the situation and find more balanced perspectives?\\nAnswers: How you think about something impacts your feelings and your behaviours. \\n When we feel stressed out, angry, or fearful, it\\'s hard to look at the situation realistically and see all of the options we have. (Remember: we all control our own actions and reactions, no matter what\\'s going on in the world. We can call do something about this pandemic.) \\n People often overestimate the negative parts—their own feelings, their own abilities to manage a difficult situation, or the situation itself—and underestimate positive parts—their own abilities to care for themselves and loved ones, their support networks, and opportunities. \\n How does the thought \"We\\'re never going to make it through this!\" make you feel? It likely doesn\\'t feel good—and it isn\\'t even true. \\n Challenging negative, unhelpful thoughts can improve your mood, validate your ability to get through this, and help you see new options or opportunities to stay well. \\n Stop and notice thoughts that come up. How do they make you feel? Do your thoughts seem realistic if you look at the situation more objectively? How can you reframe the thought to make it more productive or hopeful? Can you find any positive aspects or think of new ways to approach the situation? \\n Here are a few example: \\n \"I\\'m so mad that my event was cancelled! This sucks!\" \\n \"I know this is the safer option for everyone. When it\\'s rescheduled, I\\'ll enjoy it more because I won\\'t have to worry about getting sick or spreading the illness.\" \\n \"I hate spending so much time at home. This is so boring.\" \\n \"I\\'m doing my part to keep my neighbours safe. It\\'s worth it because it keeps people healthy.\" \\n \"I\\'m having a hard time getting used to my new schedule. This is so frustrating.\" \\n \"I\\'ll get used to this soon, just like I adapted the last time I had to change my schedule. Now that I\\'m home more, I\\'ll have more time to finish the projects I haven\\'t touched in months and I\\'m excited to see the end results. \\n \"I\\'m really scared and I don\\'t know what to do. I feel so overwhelmed right now.\" \\n \"It makes sense that I feel scared—people are getting sick and we don\\'t know when things will go back to normal. But there are a lot of things I can do to keep healthy, and I\\'m going to do some research so I can do my best. When I focus on the things I can do, everything feels more manageable.\" \\n \"We\\'re going to be stuck inside forever. I\\'m already sick of this.\" \\n \"I understand that it will take some time to manage COVID-19, and I trust that health care professionals and scientists are working as fast as they can. I know this will end eventually and life will go back to normal.\" \\n The goal is not to ignore the bad or uncomfortable parts of the situation or deny that there\\'s a problem.

              "  Document(page_content='Question_ID: 7535002\\nQuestions: How can I challenge thinking traps?\\nAnswers: What you tell yourself about a situation affects how you feel and what you do. Sometimes your interpretation of a situation can get distorted and you only focus on the negative aspects—this is normal and expected. However, when you interpret situations too negatively, you might feel worse. You\\'re also more likely to respond to the situation in ways that are unhelpful in the long term. \\n These automatic thoughts and assumptions are sometimes called thinking traps. Everyone falls into unbalanced thinking traps from time to time. You\\'re most likely to distort your interpretation of things when you already feel sad, angry, anxious, depressed or stressed. You\\'re also more vulnerable to thinking traps when you\\'re not taking good care of yourself, like when you\\'re not eating or sleeping well. \\n Here are some common thinking traps: \\n Thinking that a negative situation is part of a constant cycle of bad things that happen. People who overgeneralize often use words like \"always\" or \"never.\" \\n I was really looking forward to that concert, and now it’s cancelled. This always happens to me! I never get to do fun things! \\n Seeing things as only right or wrong, good or bad, perfect or terrible. People who think in black and white terms see a small mistake as a total failure. \\n I wanted to eat healthier, but I ate too many snacks today. This plan is a total failure! \\n Saying only negative things about yourself or other people. \\n I made a mistake. I\\'m stupid! My boss told me that I made a mistake. My boss is a total jerk! \\n Predicting that something bad will happen without any evidence. \\n I\\'ve been doing what I can to stay home and reduce the risks, but I just know that I\\'m going to get sick. \\n Focusing only on the negative parts of a situation and ignoring anything good or positive. \\n I know there\\'s a lot I can do at home, but I\\'m just so sick of this. Everything is terrible. \\n Believing that bad feelings or emotions reflect the situation. \\n I feel scared and overwhelmed right now, so that must mean everything is very bad and will never get better. \\n Telling yourself how you \"should\" or \"must\" act. \\n I should be able to handle this without getting upset and crying! \\n Here are helpful strategies to challenge common thinking traps. Many people find their mood and confidence improve after working through these skills. You can also find worksheets to help you go through each step at www.heretohelp.bc.ca. \\n Don\\'t try to get out of a thinking trap by just telling yourself to stop thinking that way. \\n This doesn\\'t let you look at the evidence and challenge the thinking trap. When you try and push upsetting thoughts away, they are more likely to keep popping back into your mind. \\n Ask yourself the following questions when something upsetting happens: \\n What is the situation? What actually happened? Only include facts that everyone would agree on. \\n What are your thoughts? What are you telling yourself? \\n What are your emotions? How do you feel? \\n What are your behaviours? How are you reacting? What are you doing to cope? \\n Take a look at the thoughts you\\'ve listed. Are you using any of the thinking traps and falling into distorted thinking patterns? It\\'s common to fall into more than one thinking trap. Go back to the thinking trap list and identify which ones apply to you and your current situation. \\n The best way to break a thinking trap is to look at your thoughts like a scientist and consider the hard facts. Use the evidence you\\'ve collected to challenge your thinking traps. Here are some ways to do that: \\n Try to find evidence against the thought. If you make a mistake at work, you might automatically think, \"I can\\'t do anything right! I must be a terrible employee!\" When this thought comes up, you might challenge it by asking, \"Is there any evidence to support this thought? Is there any evidence to disprove this thought?\" You might quickly realize that your boss has complimented your work recently, which doesn\\'t support the idea that you\\'re a bad employee. \\n Ask yourself, \"Would I judge other people if they did the same thing? Am I being harder on myself than I am on other people?\" This is a great method for challenging thinking traps that involve harsh self-criticism. \\n Find out whether other people you trust agree with your thoughts. For example, you might have trouble with one of your kids and think, \"Good parents wouldn\\'t have this kind of problem.\" To challenge this thought, you can ask other parents if they\\'ve ever had any problems with their kids. \\n Test your beliefs in person. For example, if you think that your friends don\\'t care about you, call a few friends and make plans to start a regular video call. If you assumed that they will all say no, you may be pleasantly surprised to hear that they do want to see you. \\n Once you have worked through some challenges, try to think of a more balanced thought to replace the old thinking traps. Let\\'s use the following example: \\n I feel sad and overwhelmed. I\\'m having a hard time figuring out what to do. \\n I\\'m the worst! I should be able to handle this! \\n Labeling \\n \\'Should\\' statements \\n Examine the evidence: I have a lot of challenges right now. I\\'m worried about my family and everything seems to change so quickly. I\\'ve successfully handled complicated situations in the past, so I know I can do this. \\n It\\'s okay to feel upset right now—there\\'s a lot going on. I\\'m going to think about how I got through past situations and see what worked for me. I\\'m trying to do a lot on my own, so I\\'m going to talk to my family so we can make a plan and work together. \\n Try the Healthy Thinking Worksheet at www.heretohelp.bc.ca \\n Check out Anxiety Canada\\'s articles Helpful Thinking and Thinking Traps \\n This page is adapted from Wellness Module 8: Healthy Thinking at www.heretohelp.bc.ca/wellness-module/wellness-module-8-healthy-thinking.', metadata={'row': 40, 'source': 'How can I challenge thinking traps?'})]}"
